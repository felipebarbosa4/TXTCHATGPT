-------------------------------
To modify your code to work with a `docx` file instead of a `txt` file, you will need to use the `python-docx` module. This module allows you to open, read, and write Microsoft Word `.docx` files. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:
```shell
pip install python-docx
```

Now, let's adapt your code to handle `.docx` files:

```python
import openai
import os
import time
import logging
from docx import Document

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Your original functions here (kept for context)

def process_docx_file(file_path, api_key, last_processed):
    trigger_phrase = "STARTING321"
    stop_phrase = "STOPTa"
    modified = False
    stop = False

    # Open the docx file
    document = Document(file_path)
    paragraphs = document.paragraphs[last_processed:]

    new_content = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        text = paragraph.text
        if stop_phrase in text:
            stop = True
            break
        if trigger_phrase in text:
            question = text.split(trigger_phrase)[-1].strip()
            logging.info(f"Trigger phrase found, sending query: {question}")
            response = query_chatgpt(question, api_key)
            if response:
                new_content.append(response)
                modified = True
                print(response)
                logging.info("Received response from ChatGPT, updating document.")
            else:
                logging.warning("No response received, skipping update.")
    if modified:
        for response in new_content:
            document.add_paragraph(response)
        document.save(file_path)
        logging.info("Document updated with new responses.")

    last_processed += len(paragraphs)
    return last_processed, stop

def watch_docx_file(file_path, interval, api_key):
    last_processed = 0
    logging.info(f"Starting to watch document: {file_path}")
    while True:
        try:
            last_processed, stop = process_docx_file(file_path, api_key, last_processed)
            if stop:
                logging.info("Stop phrase detected, stopping the watcher.")
                break
            time.sleep(interval)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            logging.info("Manual interruption received, stopping the watcher.")
            break
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            break

def main():
    # Path to your Word document
    file_path = 'mydoc.docx'

    # How often to check the document for changes (in seconds)
    check_interval = 5

    # Your OpenAI API key
    api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        logging.error("OpenAI API key not found. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")
        return

    watch_docx_file(file_path, check_interval, api_key)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note the following changes from your original code:

1. The `process_text_file` function has been replaced with `process_docx_file`, which processes `.docx` files.
2. The `watch_file` function has been replaced with `watch_docx_file` to work with `.docx` files.
3. Instead of opening and reading a text file, we are using the `Document` class from `python-docx` to work with paragraphs in the `.docx` file.

With these changes, your script should be able to check and work inside `mydoc.docx`. Ensure that you have the correct path to your `.docx` file and your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in your environment variables.
